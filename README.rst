This is Nuitka-Python
=====================

This is a fork of CPython, that is called Nuitka-Python, and diverges in various
ways from the original.

Our immediate goals are:

- ☑  Windows: Add static linking (performance and lock down)
- ☑  Windows: Reenable Windows 7 support (because why not)
- ☑  LTO linking on Windows (performance and deployment size)
- ☑  Automatic patches for packages built from pip
- ☐  Support all major packages and provide upstream guidance.

Installation
============

Currently, you have to build Nuitka-Python from source code. It is questionable
if deploying binaries makes sense, as you will have to compile from source code
everything else that is installed afterwards, and the ``python.exe`` will be
self-modifying with pip installs.

Use the following command in the root of a Nuitka-Python repository checkout:

.. code:: sh

    build.bat -x64

This produces a portable Python installation in the ``output`` folder. It has a
``pip`` and ``setuptools``, but not ``wheel`` out of the box. Nuitka-Python
supports these all of these though, with differences to standard CPython that
make it essentially always compile from source. Esp. the architecture of
Nuitka-Python will be different, so binary wheels uploaded to PyPI cannot be
installed, which will make it fallback to compiling from source.

The ``output`` folder can be moved freely, even to other machines. When you
install via ``python.exe -m pip`` however, it will be self-modifying the
``python.exe`` to include the newly installed packages with static linking.
