This is Nuitka-Python
=====================

This is a fork of CPython, that is not called CPython, but Nuitka-Python and diverges
in various ways.

Our immediate goals are:

* Windows: Add static linking (performance and lock down).
* Windows: Reenable Windows 7 support (because why not).
* LTO linking on Windows (performance and deployment size)
